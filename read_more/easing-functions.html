    <p class="page-introduction">
      Easing functions are used in animations to control the rate of change of an animation over time. They help make animations feel more natural and dynamic by adjusting the speed at which the animation progresses.
    </p>

      <h2>What Are Easing Functions?</h2>
      <p>
        Easing functions define the acceleration and deceleration of an animation. By using these functions, you can create smoother transitions that mimic real-world motion, such as the way objects slow down or speed up. There are several types of easing functions, including ease-in, ease-out, and ease-in-out.
      </p>

      <h3>Common Types of Easing Functions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ease In:</strong> Starts slow and accelerates over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Ease Out:</strong> Starts fast and decelerates toward the end.</li>
        <li><strong>Ease In Out:</strong> Starts slow, accelerates in the middle, and decelerates at the end.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why Use Easing Functions?</h3>
      <p>
        Without easing, animations can feel robotic and unnatural. By incorporating easing functions, you can create animations that feel more lifelike, smooth, and pleasing to the eye. These functions are crucial for making animations in user interfaces feel responsive and intuitive.
      </p>

      <h3>Examples of Easing Functions in Action</h3>
      <p>
        Here's how the most commonly used easing functions look when applied to an animation:

        <!-- Example of ease-in, ease-out, and ease-in-out animations -->
        <div class="animation-box ease-in">Ease In</div>
        <div class="animation-box ease-out">Ease Out</div>
        <div class="animation-box ease-in-out">Ease In Out</div>
      </div>
